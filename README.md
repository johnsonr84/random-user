## Description

* Random User utilizes React Hooks to filter and sort members by first and / or last name.
* Click on the member to view their individual profile page which features a large picture of the member, the member‚Äôs first and last name, street, city, state, postcode, email address, date of birth, and phone number.
* The UI is broken up into components, managed by state and responds to user events.
* The member data is retrieved using an HTTP request to the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) 
* I am hoping this test will be technically, logically and programatically correct to the guidlines set forth in the "Random User Test" document and will serve to facilitate my goal for gainful full-time employment, enabling me to not only lead a productive and meaningful daily life, but also so that I may continue purchase my dog endless amounts of squeek toys, bones, retractable leashes and cheesy (but cute) dog sweaters... üê∂
